UNIX BUILD NOTES
====================

To Build
---------------------

	cd ULTC
	mkdir boost
	cd boost
	unzip ../contrib/precompiled/boost-linux64-1.55.0.zip
	export BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH=$(pwd)/include
	export BOOST_LIB_PATH=$(pwd)/lib
	export BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX=-mt
   cd ..
	cd src/
	make -f makefile.unix		# Headless umbrella-ltcd
	cd ..
	qmake BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH=$BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH BOOST_LIB_PATH=$BOOST_LIB_PATH BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX=$BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX USE_SSE2=1
	make # Qt wallet

Security
--------
To help make your umbrella-ltc installation more secure by making certain attacks impossible to
exploit even if a vulnerability is found, you can take the following measures:

* Position Independent Executable
    Build position independent code to take advantage of Address Space Layout Randomization
    offered by some kernels. An attacker who is able to cause execution of code at an arbitrary
    memory location is thwarted if he doesn't know where anything useful is located.
    The stack and heap are randomly located by default but this allows the code section to be
    randomly located as well.

    On an Amd64 processor where a library was not compiled with -fPIC, this will cause an error
    such as: "relocation R_X86_64_32 against `......' can not be used when making a shared object;"

    To build with PIE, use:
    make -f makefile.unix ... -e PIE=1

    To test that you have built PIE executable, install scanelf, part of paxutils, and use:

    	scanelf -e ./umbrella-ltc

    The output should contain:
     TYPE
    ET_DYN

* Non-executable Stack
    If the stack is executable then trivial stack based buffer overflow exploits are possible if
    vulnerable buffers are found. By default, bitcoin should be built with a non-executable stack
    but if one of the libraries it uses asks for an executable stack or someone makes a mistake
    and uses a compiler extension which requires an executable stack, it will silently build an
    executable without the non-executable stack protection.

    To verify that the stack is non-executable after compiling use:
    `scanelf -e ./umbrella-ltc`

    the output should contain:
	STK/REL/PTL
	RW- R-- RW-

    The STK RW- means that the stack is readable and writeable but not executable.
